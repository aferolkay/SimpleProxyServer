# SimpleProxyServer
In this assignment I was able to successfully implement  a server in MATLAB , a proxy server in python and  a client in python. The system supports 4 commands which are, PUT, ADD, GET, CLR. Communication between  each system is in the form of “OP=XXX;IND=IND0,IND1,…,INDn;DATA=DATA0,DATA1,…,DATAn”.
